# Object Oriented Programming with C++

This repository contains resources and examples for learning object-oriented programming (OOP) with C++.

## What is OOP?

OOP is a programming paradigm that is based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data and code that manipulates that data. OOP helps to improve the organization and structure of code, and promotes code reuse and modularity.

## Key Concepts

- **Classes**: A class is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines the data and behavior of the objects.

- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulation is the process of bundling data and the functions that operate on that data within a single unit, or object.

- **Inheritance**: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows one class to inherit the properties and methods of another class. This allows for code reuse and helps to reduce duplication of code.

- **Polymorphism**: Polymorphism is the ability of a function or an object to take on multiple forms. In C++, this can be achieved through function overloading and function overriding.

- **Abstraction**: Abstraction is the process of hiding the implementation details of a class from the user. This helps to reduce complexity and improve the reliability of the code.

- **Access Modifiers**: Access modifiers are keywords that control the visibility and accessibility of class members (data members and member functions). C++ has the following access modifiers: `public`, `private`, and `protected`.

## Examples

This repository contains a variety of examples that illustrate the use of OOP in C++. Each example is self-contained and demonstrates a specific aspect of OOP.

## Getting Started

To get started with these examples, you will need a C++ compiler and a text editor. You can use any C++ compiler that you like, such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) or [Microsoft Visual C++](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/). You can also use a [development environment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment) such as [Code::Blocks](http://www.codeblocks.org/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/) if you prefer.

Once you have a compiler and a text editor set up, you can download the examples from this repository and build and run them on your machine.
